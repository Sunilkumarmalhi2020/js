Variable Let

The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0;
// SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared
but with var we can declare again like
var x = "John Doe";
var x = 0;
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
